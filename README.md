## COVID-SQL-Data-Exploration
Welcome to the COVID-19 Data Analysis project! This project aims to provide valuable insights into the COVID-19 pandemic using data sourced from Our World in Data (ourworldindata.org). Through careful analysis and visualization, we've explored various aspects of the pandemic to gain a deeper understanding of its impact.
# Project Overview
In this project, we've conducted a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data, focusing on multiple key areas. We've identified cities that have experienced a significant surge in COVID-19 related deaths recently, shedding light on areas that might need immediate attention and resources. Additionally, we've delved into global trends, examining the relationship between vaccination rates and death trends across different countries. This analysis can offer valuable insights into the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns and their impact on reducing mortality rates.

# Queries and Data Manipulation
Our analysis is driven by a series of ten well-crafted SQL queries that enable us to extract meaningful information from the provided dataset. These queries cover a range of topics, including city-level death trends, country-level vaccination rates, and more. By employing these queries, we've been able to unearth patterns, correlations, and trends within the data that contribute to a comprehensive picture of the pandemic's progression.

# Data Visualization
To effectively communicate our findings, we've employed data visualization techniques. Visual representations such as graphs, charts, and maps have been used to present our insights in a clear and concise manner. These visuals not only enhance the understandability of our analysis but also enable stakeholders to quickly grasp the nuances of the data.

# Getting Started
To explore our analysis and findings, you can clone this repository and navigate through the provided SQL queries, analysis code, and visualization assets. The project is structured in a way that encourages easy replication and extension, allowing you to adapt the methods to other datasets or research questions.
